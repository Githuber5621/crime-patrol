# Crime Trends & Law Enforcement Charts

## Overview

Added two additional dynamic charts to the dashboard: **Crime Trends** (line chart) and **Law Enforcement & Response** (horizontal bar chart).

## New Chart Features

### ðŸ“ˆ **Crime Trends Line Chart**

**Purpose**: Visualizes the distribution and trends of different crime types in your database.

**Features**:

- **Interactive line chart** showing incident counts by type
- **Color-coded legend** for easy identification of crime types
- **Responsive tooltips** with detailed information
- **Dynamic data labels** showing exact values
- **Top 6 crime types** displayed in legend for clarity

**Data Source**:

- Fetches from `reports_main` collection
- Groups incidents by `incident_type` field
- Sorts by frequency (most common crimes first)
- Displays top 10 crime types

**Visual Elements**:

- **Line color**: Blue (#3b82f6)
- **Dot colors**: Match primary color scheme
- **Grid**: Subtle dashed lines for reference
- **Rotated labels**: -45Â° angle to prevent overlap

### ðŸš“ **Law Enforcement & Response Horizontal Bar Chart**

**Purpose**: Displays key law enforcement metrics and response statistics.

**Metrics Displayed**:

1. **Emergency Calls**: Count of emergency pings from database
2. **Avg. Response Time**: Estimated response time (5-20 minutes)
3. **Cases Closed**: Count of resolved/closed reports
4. **Officers Deployed**: Estimated based on active cases (~60% of active cases)
5. **Patrol Routes**: Estimated routes based on total reports (1 per 50 reports, minimum 3)

**Features**:

- **Horizontal layout** for easy reading of metric names
- **Color-coded bars** using secondary color scheme
- **Value labels** displayed on the right of each bar
- **Responsive tooltips** for detailed information
- **Dynamic calculations** based on real database data

**Data Processing**:

- **Real metrics**: Emergency calls, cases closed
- **Estimated metrics**: Response time, officers deployed, patrol routes
- **Smart calculations**: Proportional to actual data volume

## Technical Implementation

### Data Integration

```javascript
// Real data from database
const emergencyCallsCount = emergencyPings.length;
const casesClosedCount = resolvedReports;

// Intelligent estimates based on real data
const officersDeployed = Math.round(activeReports * 0.6);
const patrolRoutes = Math.max(3, Math.round(totalReports / 50));
```

### Chart Configuration

**Crime Trends Chart**:

- **Chart Type**: LineChart from recharts
- **Data Source**: `dashboardData.incidentTypes`
- **Responsive**: 320px height, full width
- **Interactive**: Hover effects and tooltips

**Law Enforcement Chart**:

- **Chart Type**: Horizontal BarChart from recharts
- **Data Source**: `dashboardData.lawEnforcementStats`
- **Responsive**: 320px height, full width
- **Label positioning**: Right-aligned for clarity

### Color Schemes

**Crime Trends**:

- Uses `colorSchemes.primary` array
- Cycles through 6 colors for different crime types
- Consistent with other dashboard elements

**Law Enforcement**:

- Uses `colorSchemes.secondary` array
- Distinct colors for each metric
- Professional blue/green palette

### Responsive Design

Both charts include:

- **Mobile-friendly** sizing and layouts
- **Dark mode support** with appropriate color adjustments
- **Proper spacing** and padding for readability
- **Error handling** with fallback messages

## Data Requirements

### For Crime Trends Chart

- `reports_main` collection with `incident_type` field
- Valid incident type values from your constants
- At least 1 report for chart to display

### For Law Enforcement Chart

- `reports_main` for cases closed calculation
- `emergency_pings` collection for emergency calls
- Active reports count from status filtering

## Error Handling

Both charts include graceful fallbacks:

- **No data messages** when collections are empty
- **Loading states** during data fetching
- **Error boundaries** for data processing issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- **Real-time response time** tracking from database
- **Officer deployment** data from dedicated collection
- **Patrol route** mapping integration
- **Time-based trending** for crime patterns
- **Comparative analysis** between time periods

These charts provide valuable insights into crime patterns and law enforcement effectiveness, making the dashboard a comprehensive tool for crime analysis and resource planning.
